During the background reserach on New Balance, our team happens to discover the New Balance Gives Back program that is rarely known by New Balance current and potential customers.

Our team sees the branding value of this program and proposed a mobile application idea to further strengthen NB’s public image as an social responsible company and promote New Balance’s propducts within the application as well.</div>
