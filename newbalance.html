	<div class="post-paragraph text-column">This is a student project, of which the purpose is to promote New Balance by any type of digital media. During the background reserach on New Balance, our team happens to discover the New Balance Gives Back program that is rarely known by New Balance current and potential customers. New Balance Gives Back is a program where New Balance commited to help deserving organizations raise awareness and funds for their causes. Our team sees the branding value of this program and proposed a mobile application idea to further strengthen NB’s public image as an social responsible company and promote New Balance’s propducts within the application as well.</div>

	<div class="post-sub-title">Reflection</div>
	<div class="post-paragraph text-column">
			This is one of the first design sprints I have ever worked on. My gains from the process of collaborating and practicing are fruitful. I  would  like to share my  thoughts  about a few different  aspects.
			<br>
			<br>
			<span class="post-bullet-point">Design Process</span>
			<br>
			Having worked as a landscape designer before, I found the design process is very similar to what I have been trained. Just like what I did as a landscape designer, we started with researching and understanding the problems. Brainstorming and sketching ideas from different perspectives, narrowing down ideas, focus on fewer ideas and further develop them, making prototype, seeking for feed back, reiterating the  design, the whole process is not new to me at all. As design that is related to people, landscape and UIUX both concern about how people will be interacting with our products. For landscape, it is how people feel and move in the physical spaces, while for UIUX of digital products, it is how people going to navigate though the digital contents.  It is the functions and forms that are different. The cores of their processes are alike. So does their underlaying  value, to serve people and offer them delightful experience. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<span class="post-bullet-point">Interface Design</span>
			<br>
			When it comes to the interface design, I realized that my understanding of how styles of different elements and the arrangement of them affect people’s decisions is restricted by my limited experience so far. I am planning to do More case studies of different apps and UI design practices for my future study.
			<br>
			<br>
			<span class="post-bullet-point">Gains from User Test</span>
			<br>
			One thing I found significantly different between digital product design and landscape design is the user test part. In UIUX design, you can provide users with prototype  that is very alike to the final products in terms of form and experience, from which you will be able to  receive very effective  feedbacks from users.  Whereas in landscape design, it  is  costly to  provide  1:1 prototype to people. Inevitably, the discrepancies between design  representations and future constructed project  in landscape design will cause different degrees  of  mis-perception and make the feedback less effective to  the design iteration. I  like how you are able to  collect and utilize users’ feedback quickly  and  effectively at  different  stages of UIUX design, which  made the  whole design approach and final  products user-centered. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<span class="post-bullet-point">Collaboration</span>
			<br>
			One of the challenges we have on collaboration is the disagreement within our team on different ideas. I found the vote system mechanism from sprint methods quite effective in this case. However, discussion and debates are still unavoidable. Listening and understanding are critical. Bearing big picture and intention in mind when making group decisions helped us keep our project on track.
